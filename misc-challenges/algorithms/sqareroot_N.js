/**
 * The two crystal ball problems
 * 
 * Given two crystal balls that will drop from high enough distance
 * determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most optimized place.
 * 
 * 
 * NOTES
 * So this problem would work linearly in a linear serch an also a binary serach because we dont know where True would be
 * 
 * Therefore we want to break the hi and low by the squareroot, loook through that and then jump
 * This will give us O(sqrt(N))
